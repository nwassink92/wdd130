      <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
      <p>
        This website aims simply to be a cute little catalogue of games that are relatively obscure and are completely free to play. I am attempting to only recommend games that I’ve personally played, though there may be considerations towards games that look noteworthy otherwise. There is also an arbitrary limitation that each game has to be from different sources (like they can’t all be from Steam), but that’s mostly for the sake of the project and advertising variety. I’d also prefer that the games are easily accessible, like they won’t need extra programs or translation docs to play, though I may add such games later as I feel inclined.
      </p>
      <p><b>Theme and Feel</b></p>
      <p>
        The main page needs to communicate the fun, excited feeling of finding games on a shelf in like a rental shop or some kind of thrift store. These aren’t games that are large, critically acclaimed features; they’re those odd little gems found amongst all the other things no one gives attention to. Thus, the website must be a little cozy, a little arcadey, but all about the thrill of finding something new. The icon is a pixelated pickaxe to convey that we’re going to be digging deep into the video game realm. Also, the visual connection to Minecraft is a happy coincidence, as Minecraft itself started as a cheap indie title and has become one of the top-selling games of all time; the games presented hope to capture that sense of finding something cool and passionately made.
      </p>
      <p><b>Audience</b></p>
      <p>
        The audience is a little undefined. My ideal is that these games will get attention from most anyone (I mean, people who play video games), thus expanding their popularity, but I can’t be thinking so big at this point. For now, let’s settle on grabbing the attention of those who may be seeking out hidden gems or playing on a budget. Obviously, the games being free will be advantageous to people saving money, but they must have some significant length as well in order to truly appeal. Furthermore, the games are likely all going to be able to be played on low-end machines, so no one has to consider having monster computers in order to enjoy these titles.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        The first game I am considering is Iji. There is a bit of recency bias concerning this game with me, but I also do consider this one of my favorite gaming experiences in recent years. Iji is a novel action-platformer with an RPG-esque upgrade system that sees the player single-handedly fending off an alien invasion. What makes this different from other action-platformers, though, is that the game offers the ability to not kill anyone and everyone standing in your way. In fact, interactions with the characters in the story will change depending on how bloodthirsty you get. In this vein, I may draw comparisons to Undertale to help sell people on it, as both have the gimmick of choosing pacifism over violence, though Iji falls more on the grim, hopeless side of war more than the often lighthearted Undertale.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        The next game is Overclocked. This game’s name does it no favors, as searching for “overclocked game” in most search engines usually gets tech and gear related results. Regardless, Overclocked is another action-platformer; where Iji is more jumpy-shooty and about exploration, Overclocked is about speed and precision, seeing players fly over obstacles and scale walls in seconds flat. To that end, comparisons will be made to games like Super Meat Boy or Celeste (a hidden gem!), in no small part because I was playing Celeste about the same time anyway. Overclocked is relatively short (as is Iji, actually), but has that replayability inherent in speedrun-type games.

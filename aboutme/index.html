    <h2>Nathaniel Wassink</h2>
    <h2>Alias: Nate</h2>
    <p>I'm a hip young person, like you! I am in college and working on a degree as any human does. Because I am a human, like you! I enjoy various human activities, like the Internet or other popular media like movies. I may have even seen a movie at one point! It was a delightful human experience! Oh, it is so great being a human right now. Hope you all are grateful for your humanity, like I am!
